BASICALLY WE CREATED A VIRTUAL ENVIOURNMENT TO SHOW AN OPTIMAL SOLUTION
ALTHO DUE TO LACK OF TIME WE WERE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT 100% OF OUR IDEA ON OUR GAME
ACTUALLY THE FILE SIZE OF OUR WHOLE PROJECT IS 25+ GB WHICH WE WERE UNABLE TO UPLOAD COMPLETELY 
SO WE HAVE SHARED THE BASE FILE OF OUR UNREAL PROJECT 
IF YOU EVER WANT ANY WORK REGARDING VIRTUAL ENVIOURNMENT OR ANY TYPES OF GAMES THEN CONTACT ME ON LINKEDIN https://www.linkedin.com/in/aayush-91533921a/
THANK YOU ^^
